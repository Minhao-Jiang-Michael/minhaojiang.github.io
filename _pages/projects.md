Deep Learning with Medical Image Analysis
---
(01/2021 - Present)
* Implemented deep learning models, including CNNs, GANs, and image recognition topologies including AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG, and Inception, etc., to predict the survival of breast cancer patients, advised by Ms. Xiaoxia Liao at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
* Conducted ongoing experiments with proposal of using multiphoton histopathology for datasets in information extracted from the tumor micro-environment provided by NCSA.

DARPA SocialSim Project
---
(11/2020 - 01/2021)
* Worked on on the DARPA project computational simulation of online social behavior project supervised by Prof. Tarek F. Abdelzaher and Prof. Jiawei Han.
* Responsible for a machine learning model implemented by Random Forest as a purpose of prediction.
