I am a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science, Mathamatics at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am fortunated to be working in [Data Mining Group (DMG)](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).

My current research area is in **Machine Learning** and **Graph Mining**. And my exploration interests lie in the intersections of general **Machine Learning theory**, **Data Mining** and **Deep Learning**.

Here is my latest version [CV](https://minhaoj2.github.io/files/CV.pdf) (maybe not up-to-date).
