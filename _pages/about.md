I am a junior undergraduate student in Computer Science, Mathamatics at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am fortunated to be advised by Prof. [Sanmi Koyejo](https://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/)@[UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) working on the research related to Active Learning.

My current research area is in **Machine Learning** and **Graph Mining**. And my exploration interests lie in the intersections of general **Machine Learning** theory, **Data Mining** and **Computer Vision**.

Here is my latest version [CV](https://minhaoj2.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
