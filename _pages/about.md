I am a junior undergraduate student in Computer Science, Mathamatics at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am fortunated to be advised by Prof. [Sanmi Koyejo](https://sanmi.cs.illinois.edu/)@[UIUC](https://illinois.edu/).

My current research area is in **Graph Mining** and **Deep Learning**. And my exploration interests lie in the intersections of general **Machine Learning** theory, **Data Mining** and **Computer Vision**.
