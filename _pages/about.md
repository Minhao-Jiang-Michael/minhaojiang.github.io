I'm currently an AI Scientist at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/), working on Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science, and B.S. with a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in [Data Mining Group (DMG)](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/), where I was fortunately advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).

My current research area is in **Trustworthy Machine Learning** and **AI For Science**. My exploration interests lie in the intersections of general **Natural Language Processing**, **Large Language Models**, and **Deep Learning**.
